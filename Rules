Rules:


1.[FIRST MOVE] The very first move of the game is an open move, i.e. Any cell on the entire board is valid.  
2.[CORRESPONDENCE RULE] If the opponent places his/her marker in any of the cells, except for the center 
cell of a block, then you need to place your marker anywhere in the two blocks adjacent to the block 
corresponding to the cell. For example, for the top left cell, the next player needs to move in center left and 
top center. Similarly for the right center cell, top right and bottom right blocks are open. Please refer to the 
code for more clarity. 
3.[CENTER RULE] If the opponent places his/her marker in the center cell of any block, then you need to place 
your marker in the center block only.  
4.[FREE MOVE RULE] In case the all of the cells in the destined blocks obtained from Rule 2 or Rule 3 are 
occupied, then the player may move in any free cell in the entire board. 
5.[ABANDON RULE] Once a block is won by a player, it has to be abandoned. That is, you may consider the 
entire block to be full and no other player may play in that block. 
6.[WIN RULE] The player who wins any three blocks which are either a row, column or diagonal of the board, 
wins the game and the game is over. If all the cells are filled, and no pattern has been formed then the game is
over.
